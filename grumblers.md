# Christian Grumbling & Worship

## Inspiration

Pastor Tim was preaching on 1 Cor 10:6-11 this morning. He did a great job explaining how Paul talks about the many times Israel defied God, and how they are to be an example to the Church (which is not surprising, given that the Church is the continuing covenant people of God).

The first example that Paul gives, that of the people grumbling that they "only have the manna from heaven to eat" triggered something in my brain that I wanted to write about here.
