# Christian Grumbling & Worship

## Inspiration

Pastor Tim was preaching on 1 Cor 10:6-11 this morning. He did a great job explaining how Paul talks about the many times Israel defied God, and how they are to be an example to the Church (which is not surprising, given that the Church is the continuing covenant people of God).

The first example that Paul gives, that of the people grumbling that they "only have the manna from heaven to eat" triggered something in my brain that I wanted to write about here.

## Grumbling Israelites

See, the Israelites have been brought out of bondage from Egypt by God's miraculous works, have been given the freedom to worship Him, and are now being provided food from heaven directly from God as they wander in the wilderness. They are blessed, and yet they don't seem to see it that way. They pine after the things they had to eat in Egypt, seeming to forget that they were slaves there, or at least forgetting how bad the slavery was. 

This is actually a picture I think of our redeemed selves shortly after coming to Christ, and how we look at sin. But that will have to wait for another post. Today I want to examine how I think this relates to how Christians seem to never be content with what God has given them in worship.
