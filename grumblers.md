# Christian Grumbling & Worship

## Inspiration

Pastor Tim was preaching on 1 Cor 10:6-11 this morning. He did a great job explaining how Paul talks about the many times Israel defied God, and how they are to be an example to the Church (which is not surprising, given that the Church is the continuing covenant people of God).

The first example that Paul gives, that of the people grumbling that they "only have the manna from heaven to eat" triggered something in my brain that I wanted to write about here.

## Grumbling Israelites

See, the Israelites have been brought out of bondage from Egypt by God's miraculous works, have been given the freedom to worship Him, and are now being provided food from heaven directly from God as they wander in the wilderness. They are blessed, and yet they don't seem to see it that way. They pine after the things they had to eat in Egypt, seeming to forget that they were slaves there, or at least forgetting how bad the slavery was. 

This is actually a picture I think of our redeemed selves shortly after coming to Christ, and how we look at our former life (especially when persecution starts). But that will have to wait for another post. Today I want to examine how I think this relates to how Christians seem to never be content with what God has given them in worship.

## Grumbling Christians

### Food from Heaven

Let us use this analogy. The Church is God's covenant people. They are redeemed, and they are to "feed on God's Word", *i.e.* the scriptures. This food is all that we **really** need in our worship, it gives us instruction for:

  * how we are to worship (including the sacraments)
  * what is to be included in worship

In addition to that, it should be the **meat** of our worship, *i.e.* the expounding (presenting and explaining) of God's Word should be a **primary** (note I said primary, not the only thing in our worship services) part of our weekly gatherings as Christians.

This **food** has been provided by God Himself, through the prophets and apostles, and miraculous interventions that have resulted in it being preserved through the ages (does this sound like Israel's situation yet??).

### The Grumbling

So we have this wonderful food from God, that He miraculously provides for us to feed on, both personally in our daily devotions, and when we come together as a body. And what has the Church done over the ages? We've grumbled that this is **all** that God has given to us, and we want more.

So we add skits, we build mega-complexes where we can have the equivalent of a rock show, and the "preaching" of the Word is beamed to multiple locations simultaneously, we have lots of personal stories that don't have anything to do with the Bible, we have faith healers, we promise people that they can be rich if they have enough faith, we tell stories to make people feel good about themselves, we come up with our own songs to sing to God (when he provided us with an entire songbook !!!), and we even throw out His word altogether.

### The Solution??

Obviously the solution is that we need to turn to God, remember that He has provided sufficiently for us in His scriptures, and ask Him for forgiveness and to help us to see what we truly need, and to grow us in knowledge and understanding. 

Imagine what kind of reformation there would be if every man that stood in a pulpit decided that next week he was going to start **expounding** the word of God from a Christological, historical hermeneutic to his congregation, working his way throught he various books of the Old and New Testaments. And that **that** was going to be the **meat** of the worship service.
