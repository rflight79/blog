# Why is teaching your kids that Santa exists lying to your kids??

A long time ago around Christmas time, Frank Turk had posted that teaching kids about Santa is **not** lying to them [link](linkLocation). The justification was something along the lines that Santa *represents* the spirit of Christmas, doing good works, good will to others, surprise, etc. As I read the post, I started to think that in principle, he is right, pretending about Santa is not lying to them. However, in practice, this is frequently not the case.
